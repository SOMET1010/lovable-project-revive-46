  "summary": "The hero section of the Mon Toit page, dedicated to property search, is the initial prominent content area after the navigation. Based on the provided textual content, its technical implementation is inferred as follows:\n\n**HTML Structure (Inferred):**\n*   A main container element (e.g., `<section>` or `<div>`) likely wraps the entire hero content, with a class like `hero-section` or `main-banner` for styling.\n*   The primary headline, \"Trouvez votre logement idéal en Côte d'Ivoire\", would be an `<h1>` tag due to its prominence and indicated styling (underline in text).\n*   A secondary text or tagline, \"Location sécurisée • Identité vérifiée • Paiement mobile\", would likely be an `<h2>` or `<p>`, potentially using `<span>` elements or a list (`<ul>` with `<li>` for each point) for individual styling and semantic separation.\n*   A search form area is present, implied by the interactive elements \"Tous les types🏢 Appartement...Rechercher\". This would typically be a `<form>` element or a `<div>` wrapping interactive form components.\n    *   Input/selection elements for \"Tous les types\" (e.g., a `<select>` dropdown or a group of `<button>`s/radio inputs styled as buttons for \"Appartement\", \"Maison\", \"Villa\", etc.). These would likely be contained within a `<div>` for grouping.\n    *   A submit button, \"Rechercher\", implemented as a `<button type='submit'>`.\n*   A statistics display area is suggested by \"150 propriétés1250 utilisateurs5 villes\". This would likely be a `<div>` with multiple child `<div>` or `<span>` elements, each containing a number and its corresponding label.\n\n**CSS Classes (Inferred based on common web development practices):**\n*   **Layout/Containers**: `hero-section`, `hero-container`, `search-form`, `property-type-filter-group`, `hero-stats-wrapper`.\n*   **Typography**: `hero-title`, `hero-tagline`, `stat-number`, `stat-label`.\n*   **Interactive Elements**: `filter-button`, `filter-button-active` (for selected types), `search-button`, `btn-primary`.\n*   **Utility/Positioning**: Classes like `text-center`, `flex`, `grid`, `items-center`, `justify-center`, `gap-x-y`, `p-y-spacing`.\n\n**Element Positioning and Layout (Inferred):**\n*   **Overall Layout**: The hero section would be a block-level element, often styled for full viewport width and significant height (`min-height` or `height: 100vh`).\n*   **Content Alignment**: The main heading, tagline, and search form are typically horizontally centered, achieved using `text-align: center` on a parent container or by applying flexbox properties (`display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center;`).\n*   **Property Type Filters**: These elements (e.g., \"Appartement\", \"Maison\") would be laid out horizontally for desktop views, likely using `display: flex` with `gap` for spacing, or `display: grid`. On smaller screens (mobile), they might wrap onto multiple lines or stack vertically.\n*   **Search Button**: Positioned adjacent to or below the property type filters.\n*   **Statistics**: Arranged horizontally, often at the bottom of the hero section, utilizing `display: flex` and `justify-content: space-around` or `space-between` for even distribution.\n\n**Other Technical Details (Inferred):**\n*   **Responsive Design**: The hero section is highly likely to be fully responsive, adjusting its layout, font sizes, and spacing for optimal viewing on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using CSS media queries.\n*   **Background**: A prominent background (e.g., large image, video, gradient, or solid color) is commonly used to make the hero section visually appealing and distinct.\n*   **Interactivity**: The search form elements (property type buttons, search button) would have interactive states (e.g., hover, focus, active styles) to enhance user experience.\n*   **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of `<h1>`, `<form>`, `<button>` for accessibility and SEO best practices.\n*   **Whitespace**: Generous padding and margins would be used to create visual separation and improve readability around elements.\n*   **Icons**: The presence of emojis (🏢, 🏠, 🏘️, etc.) suggests the use of icons (e.g., Font Awesome, SVG icons, or emoji directly) alongside text labels for property types.",
