  "summary": "The 'Mon Toit - Plateforme de Location Immobilière' project on GitHub outlines its deployment strategy, leveraging GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Netlify is the designated platform for both staging and production environments, with the production application planned for `montoitv35.netlify.app`. The deployment process is automated: pushes to the `develop` branch trigger staging deployments, while merges to the `main` branch, following pull request reviews and CI tests, initiate production deployments. The repository includes various specialized deployment guides and scripts for production, specific components like a chatbot, and general CI/CD workflows, and also mentions testing deployments on Azure.",
